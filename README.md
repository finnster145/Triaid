<H2>How can we use available technologies to support people’s health needs and stay out of hospital?</H2>


Living in a post pandemic world, the Northern Territory government is attempting to tackle a health care crisis that is causing major delays and stress on the nationwide system. This has ultimately resulted in 18,000 avoidable deaths each year. 
So how are we able to reduce this number and ease the burden on the healthcare system? 
Well, our team has identified a common trend leading to 9% of all ED visits being unnecessary which ultimately resulted in many delays. To combat this, our team has designed an application and brochure to facilitate emergency department visits to ensure the community is making use of the appropriate resource for their injury or illness. Using our application, Triaid will make use of existing technologies to direct users to the correct resource which will assist in alleviating the stress within the emergency department and thus providing access to those that truly need it. Our application is very simple yet effective, the dominant feature within the app is the symptoms checker.

Using this tool, users will be able to enter in their current symptoms to determine what service they should use. The application will use a simple API with the Australian government system: Health Direct to generate an informed recommendation for the user. If the recommendation is to attend the ER, then an integrated map will display local Emergency Departments as well as their wait times based on the triage level determined by the application. This real time tracking of Emergency Departments is made possible by a centralised system in which local hospitals will be able to input parameters so that an algorithm is able to determine the estimated wait time. This feature gives the choice to the user about whether they really need to attend the hospital and if they choose to do so then they can attend a less crowded hospital – thus reducing the potential stress on the system. If the application deems it unnecessary to attend the Emergency Department, then it will provide a list of services that the user can contact via call or text to assist with their current symptoms – this ensures that unnecessary visits to the ED are a thing of the past. Our application also allows for the user to be notified by seasonal trends such as the flu and hay fever. This allows the user to be well informed about the potential symptoms they may experience – which could reduce the number of unnecessary visits. As a quality-of-life addition this app will allow users to access their medical history records via the integration of the myGov login service as well as being able to book local GP appointments.

Also identified within the datasets provided, there is a clear correlation between ED visits and low socio-economic status as well as with age. Therefore, we have also decided to opt for developing a physical poster that can be distributed to households across the territory. This poster is a simple to follow visual that will indicate to users on when to visit the ED and when not to visit the ED. Within this poster are the correct phone numbers to call if the user is unsure or is need of immediate medical attention. 

Overall, our solution is to provide a centralised portal to assist the community to make informed decisions before they attend to the emergency room. It can be scaled to accommodate the language needs of users if necessary. We believe that Triad is a great option to assist in diverting unnecessary traffic away from the Emergency Departments and into the appropriate health care services that are resourced to handle more people thus easing the burden on the overall Hospital system.
